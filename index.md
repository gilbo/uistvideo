## Summary

UIST will be making video recordings of talks for the first time this year.  However, those talks will not be freely available to the general public.  Going forward, let’s make it a priority that video recordings of UIST speakers are released under Creative Commons (or an equivalent license) so that researchers’ work is guaranteed to be available and accessible by the general public.

To accomplish this, we need to demonstrate broad popular support from the UIST community.  Researchers and the UIST community only stand to benefit from the increased exposure doing this will bring their work, especially to the broader professional community outside of universities and research labs.

## What action can we take?

We (Gilbert and David) will raise this issue at the UIST 2015 townhall meeting.  If you will be at UIST, please plan to stay for the town hall to show support for, and possibly vote for a popular resolution that speaker videos be put under Creative Commons or a similar license.  If you will not be at the townhall, but consider yourself to be a member of the UIST community, please [email Gilbert & David](mailto:gilbert@gilbertbernstein.com?subject=[UISTvideo]) with any statement of support you would like to offer, even if that support is as simple as co-signing your name.  We will present these statements in summarized form at the townhall.

## What is the current talk recording process?

The talk recordings are new at UIST this year.  Here’s how they will work this year:

1.  Conference speakers choose whether they want to be recorded and certify as part of the ACM rights release form that they have all the necessary copyrights for content in their talk.
2.  At UIST, the two documentarian chairs (Gilbert & David) in cooperation with student volunteers make sure the talk video and audio is recorded.  Permission to record in reconfirmed at the conference.
3.  Documentarian chairs edit the video and audio feeds together for distribution.
4.  Videos are uploaded to the ACM Digital Library

## What changes would this resolution make to the current talk recording process?

1. Speakers would complete a separate Creative Commons rights release form indicating that they have all necessary copyrights for their talk and its contents.
2. Recording would happen the same way.
3. Editing would happen the same way.
4. Videos would be uploaded to research community archives, to Youtube and/or Vimeo, and to the ACM Digital Library.  Anyone would be free to copy and redistribute these videos themselves.

# Why is this resolution necessary?

## Why do we want to make talk recordings freely available?

Making the UIST talks freely available allows hobbyists, engineers, kids in high school, journalists, and the general public to hear about research being done in our community.  While most people can’t come (or won’t come) to the UIST conference, many people have access to online videos.  Besides altruistic aims, this exposure also benefits researchers themselves by increasing the impact of their research.

## Why do the video recordings need to be licensed under Creative Commons?  (Wouldn’t it be ok to just put them on YouTube?)

While we do plan to put the videos on YouTube or a similar service, doing so isn’t sufficient to guarantee that those videos remain available.  In order to upload video to YouTube, we need to certify that we have all appropriate rights.  Unfortunately, as the videographers we do not have those rights.  While ACM could theoretically allow us to upload the videos, they could also revoke that privilege at any time.

Furthermore, simply allowing YouTube uploads does not guarantee permission for other legitimate uses of the videos.  For instance, suppose a UIST researcher decided to conduct research on better systems for watching video lectures/talks, or better systems for supporting academic conferences.  (e.g. [Cobi](http://projectcobi.com/))  They may want to host their own (annotated) copies of the video, or re-edit the existing video.  Creative Commons would ensure that any researcher can legally re-use and re-distribute the videos as part of future research.  Permission to upload videos to YouTube would not guarantee these rights.

## Will this resolution apply to the UIST 2015 videos?

Unfortunately, no.  Short explanation: In order to make video recordings we need to obtain [release forms](#release_forms) (see below).  We do not have the time to get speakers to complete a whole new set of release forms this close to the conference.  As a result, we will only be able to make the 2015 video recordings available via the ACM digital library.

## Why is vocal community support necessary?

One of the two videographers this year (Gilbert) took the volunteer position primarily to ensure open access to the video recordings.  Unfortunately, that effort was unsuccessful for reasons we’d rather not get into.  It suffices to say that without a community resolution showing support, the UIST 2016 videos will almost certainly remain behind a paywall.  With a community resolution showing broad support, next year’s videographers, as well as the entire UIST organizing committee, will be empowered by a clear mandate from the community.  By raising this issue at the townhall we can ensure public, transparent, and democratic participation in the decision.

# How might this resolution affect me (a researcher) and the UIST community?

## I am a speaker/researcher and uncomfortable with my talk being recorded.  How would this resolution affect me?

All speakers must consent to being recorded—Always—regardless of how copyright is handled.  All speakers being recorded this year must opt-in to being recorded.  This consent will be re-confirmed by volunteers before the speaker presents.  This resolution will not affect this procedure for consent in any way.


## My talks often contain copyrighted content.  How will this resolution affect me? // What is required to put a talk under a Creative Commons license? // What is a release form?

If you don’t have a copyright or a license for the content you’re using, you may already be breaking the law, regardless of whether your talk is being recorded.  However, once your talk is recorded the videographers and anyone who obtains the video from them are also legally exposed. (This is true regardless of whether the recording is put under traditional copyright or Creative Commons—that is regardless of whether UIST adopts this resolution.)  In order to limit legal exposure of the videographers and distributors, it’s common practice to require speakers to complete a rights release form.  On this form, the speaker provides documentation that they have acquired proper rights to use all content in their talk and affirms that fact.  If you have ever had a paper accepted at an ACM conference, then you’ve already seen and filled out this kind of rights release form.  In order to put talks under a Creative Commons license, speakers would simply fill out a second such form indicating that they agree for the talk and all materials used to be put under Creative Commons.  This rights release form then legally protects downstream distributors and users of all kinds, allowing them to use the talk recording freely under the terms of Creative Commons—which among other things requires them to maintain attribution to the original authors.  That said, we are not lawyers, and this is not legal advice.  UIST would need to consult with a lawyer to draft a release form.  Further information about Creative Commons can be found on their [website](https://creativecommons.org/), including example releases that a lawyer could adapt.


## What is the cost of creating the UIST speaker videos?

Thanks to our experience this year, we can provide accurate cost estimates.  The two major costs are labor and equipment.  Labor is supplied in the form of two additional “documentarians” (Gilbert and David this year) who organize the effort, direct volunteers, edit and ship the resulting digital videos to the distributor (ACM this year; services like Vimeo and Youtube if this resolution is adopted).  Recording the videos requires an additional 30 hours of student volunteer time.  This translates to approximately 2 additional student volunteers who get to attend UIST for free, but otherwise receive no monetary compensation.  This translates to an estimated opportunity cost of about $700, although since the student volunteers might otherwise not have attended at all, the real cost is debatable.
A set of 4 digital video cameras and 3 laptops were loaned from SIGCHI and constitute the total capital costs.  Shipping costs were approximately $800.  There may also be some increase in A/V contracting fees with the venue though we were unaware of any additional A/V costs this year.
In total, the real monetary costs of recording these videos is small enough to be covered by donations if necessary.  The main cost is in volunteer labor from the UIST community.


## How can Creative Commons talk recordings be archived?

We have previously reached out to researchers involved in maintaining the Cobi servers about storing backup archival copies of the videos.  Likewise, any research group with extra storage space could maintain a mirror of the UIST video archive, increasing redundancy.  For primary distribution, the videos can be uploaded to a streaming service such as Vimeo or Youtube.  In addition to these formal arrangements that the videographers could undertake, a Creative Commons license would allow any interested individual to make their own backup or mirror of the archive.  As we’ve seen with existing systems like the ArXiv, these sorts of arrangements allow for low cost and reliable archiving of academic files.  In this case, we would doubly benefit thanks to the redundancy provided by free video-streaming services.

# What about ACM?

## Would there still be copies of the videos on the digital library?

Creative Commons does not create any legal obstacles that would prevent ACM from hosting a copy of the talk recordings.  A Creative Commons license allows all parties (including ACM) to make and distribute their own copy of the talk videos without fear of legal reprisal against them.


## How would this resolution affect the papers?

This resolution only applies to the video recordings of talks at UIST.  We are not taking any broader position on issues surrounding open access to research papers.


## What is ACM’s position on this issue?

We have not contacted ACM and we are not aware of any pre-existing policy that would conflict with this resolution.  If the UIST community believes that the videos should be made available under Creative Commons, then we should adopt this resolution regardless of what future positions ACM may or may not adopt.  ACM has both fought and supported research communities in the past on copyright issues.

One example is the existing ACM policy of letting authors put copies of their papers (and also their videos I am told) on their website.  In practice, authors have also put copies of their talk recordings at ACM conferences on YouTube without being asked to remove them.

Another example is [cease and desist letters](http://realtimecollisiondetection.net/blog/?p=101) sent from ACM to Ke-Sen Huang threatening legal action against him for maintaining [his popular index of Computer Graphics papers](http://kesen.realtimerendering.com/).  Thanks to broad and vocal support from the Computer Graphics community, ACM chose to back down and allow Ke-Sen to continue operating his index with their explicit permission.

Ultimately, we believe that as a professional organization, ACM exists to serve its members.  If we as members of the UIST community democratically decided that we want to make our talk recordings available under a Creative Commons license, we expect that ACM will respect that decision, especially since the cost of doing so is negligible (see above).
